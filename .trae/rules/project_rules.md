Do not run the development server, I already run it all the time at http://localhost:8000
Tech stack use on this project is vanilla PHP, vanilla CSS, and jQuery.
For styles and scripts, place close where the view html is located.
Its a single index.php file. Everything on this 1 file only (from php, css, html dan jquery script)
Use helpers that I already define in <helpers> section.
Keep the app security always when implement the code.
For styling, use reference that I already define in :root styles.
